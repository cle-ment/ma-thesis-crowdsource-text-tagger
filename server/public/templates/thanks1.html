  <p>Your tags were saved.</p>
  <p>I'm trying to collect as many tags as possible to better understand how
    humans interpret these texts. So <strong>would be awesome if you could do
    another one ;)</strong>. Below there's a new job ad already prepared
    in case. (And you'll get another cat picture!)<br>
